# Todo list:

### 1) Noise analysis
Take one run with external random trigger and HV OFF, look at the rate per channel, and identify noisy channels. 

Do the same with HV ON and spot differences (if any).

Take one run with cosmics trigger ( scintillators ), and repeat the same analysis.
Compare the time spectra with those you had in the previous random trigger runs. 

Measure the noise in the run with cosmics trigger, removing the signal hits using the time value.

### 2) Event display

Using the run with cosmics trigger, develop a simple event display (with ROOT), in which you show the hits per event, organized per chamber, layer, tube number.

Start using the logical numbers, then transform them into real positions as measured with a ruler

You should see the spatial correlation among the hits, disposed along a track.

You can play a lot with the event display: e.g. identify single tracks, multiple tracks, showers etc...   ( in parallel with the other exercises) 

### 3) Efficiency measurement
